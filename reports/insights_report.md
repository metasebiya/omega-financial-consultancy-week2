## Ethical Considerations and Biases

It's important to acknowledge potential biases in the user review data:
- **Self-Selection Bias (Negative Skew)**: Users with exceptionally positive or negative experiences are more likely to leave reviews, potentially overrepresenting extreme sentiments compared to the average user base.
- **Extremity Bias**: Reviews often gravitate towards 1-star or 5-star ratings, with fewer reviews in the middle range, which can skew perceived average satisfaction.
- **Temporal Bias**: Recent app updates or public events might significantly influence current review sentiments, which may not reflect long-term user satisfaction.
These biases should be considered when interpreting the insights and formulating strategies.
